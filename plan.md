<think>## Detailed Implementation Plan for Project Proposal Web Application

### Overview
The goal is to create a comprehensive, investment-grade project proposal for a "Smart Community Health Monitoring and Early Warning System for Water-Borne Diseases in Rural Northeast India." The proposal will be structured in a multi-page format using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for styling. Each section of the proposal will be presented clearly and professionally.

### Step-by-Step Outline of Changes Needed

#### 1. Create a New Page Structure
- **File:** `src/app/proposal/[section].tsx`
  - Create a dynamic route to handle different sections of the proposal.
  - Use Next.js's dynamic routing to load content based on the section requested.

#### 2. Create Proposal Content
- **File:** `src/lib/proposalContent.ts`
  - Create a TypeScript file to store the content for each section of the proposal.
  - Structure the content in an organized manner, using objects or arrays for easy access.

#### 3. Implement Navigation
- **File:** `src/components/ui/ProposalNav.tsx`
  - Create a navigation component that links to each section of the proposal.
  - Use Tailwind CSS for styling to ensure a modern look.
  - Ensure the navigation is responsive and accessible.

#### 4. Design Each Section
- **Files:** `src/components/ui/ProposalSection.tsx`
  - Create a reusable component for rendering each section of the proposal.
  - Use Tailwind CSS for layout and typography.
  - Ensure that each section is visually distinct and easy to read.

#### 5. Add Error Handling
- **File:** `src/app/proposal/[section].tsx`
  - Implement error handling for cases where a section does not exist.
  - Display a user-friendly message if the section is not found.

#### 6. Create a Home Page
- **File:** `src/app/index.tsx`
  - Create a landing page that introduces the project and provides links to the proposal sections.
  - Use a clean layout with a brief overview of the project.

#### 7. Implement Tailwind CSS
- **File:** `src/app/globals.css`
  - Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured and imported.
  - Use Tailwind's utility classes throughout the application for consistent styling.

#### 8. Add Placeholder Images (if necessary)
- **Files:** In relevant sections of the proposal
  - If any images are required for visual representation, use placeholder images.
  - Example: 
    ```html
    <img src="https://placehold.co/800x600?text=Detailed+diagram+of+system+architecture" alt="Detailed diagram of system architecture" onerror="this.onerror=null; this.src='https://placehold.co/800x600?text=Image+failed+to+load';" />
    ```

### Feature Sets
- **Dynamic Routing:** Each section of the proposal will be accessible via a unique URL.
- **Responsive Design:** The application will be mobile-friendly, ensuring accessibility for all users.
- **Interactive Navigation:** Users can easily navigate between sections of the proposal.
- **Error Handling:** User-friendly messages will be displayed for any missing sections.
- **Modern UI:** The application will utilize Tailwind CSS for a clean and modern aesthetic.

### Summary
- Create a dynamic routing structure for the proposal sections.
- Implement a content management system in TypeScript for easy access to proposal content.
- Design a responsive navigation component using Tailwind CSS.
- Develop a reusable section component for consistent styling.
- Add error handling for non-existent sections.
- Create a home page to introduce the project.
- Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured for styling.
- Use placeholder images where necessary for visual representation.

This plan outlines the necessary steps to create a comprehensive project proposal web application, ensuring a modern, user-friendly interface while adhering to best practices in development.

I will follow this plan thoroughly in my implementation and implement all the files in the plan.
